## Research Ethics
1. Yes and no. Although for the purpose of advancing projects further, such as beyond the scope of regulations, utilitarians could argue that misconduct will allow unregulated testing and non-reviewed experiments to be conducted on humans to advance (for example: the gene editing done on the twins in HK/China). Such misconduct usually doesn't produce more good than harm, as it could alter people's perceptions of the regulations that are set in place to protect the public.

2. There could be a conflict of interest, as some of the members were originally part of Bell Labs. However, perhaps it is because they come from such a prestigious lab that they would adhere to their ethics to do what’s right rather than find ways to defend the misconduct of Jan Hendrik Schön. Furthermore, most of them have already established themselves in other affiliations, such as their own companies or labs, which could mitigate the conflict of interest since they too have a reputation to uphold.

3. Yes, if workplace ethics is aimed at ensuring everyone gets credit for what they've accomplished, the inverse should equally be true: the judgment from misconduct should be shared among the authors/co-authors. Once signed as authors/co-authors, ownership of the published material belongs to them. It's their responsibility to ensure the materials they publish are factual and tested before submission. It's not just about expecting all the glory but also facing the consequences.

## Corporate Ethics:
4. The employees, consumers, public, and leadership group of J&J are all stakeholders in this ethical dilemma. On one side, it is the CEO's prima facie duty to keep the shareholders and employees safe by protecting the brand name, which is associated with protecting the company's assets and financials. However, this violates beneficence, as the public and consumers are betrayed due to the CEO's decision to sweep the problem under the rug. One tool to maintain the score is to continue abiding by their company credo and changing it to better serve their stakeholders.

5. Points 1 and 2 refer to the employees of the company, which can be replaced with professional ethics, as it is in their best interests to ensure everything is of quality. In my opinion, the stakeholders they don’t really address are the consumers who will drink their products. Most of Odwalla's company credo essentially reinforces the idea that their professionalism drives the product, rather than their commitment to benefit consumers in the way the company originally intended.

To modify:
Honesty and respect for our consumers and the public.
Professionalism and trust from management and employees.
Foster open communication between management and consumers.
Innovate and strive to make the best products through employees and management.
