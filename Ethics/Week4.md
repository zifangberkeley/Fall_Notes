# Scientific Misconduct
- Fabrication of data. make up data
- Falsification of data. Falsifying the data and not exposing to sunlight that you've modified the data.
- Plagrism: stealing someone else's ideas or techniques with out giving credits.
    - if you publish it, you have to cite your own work. 
    - attribution is not required if it interferes with the teachings.

## Ethical theories connection
-   duty: to return to investors the product of your research efforts.
-   justice: appropriate credit in authorship list
-   Virtue, truthfulness in all stages of research
- rights: acknowledgement of rights of competitors by appropriate recognition
-   non_malfeasence: not committing intentional misrepresentation that hurts others.

Can utilitarian arguments apply in the context of science and engineering research misconduct. 

## Finding of research misconduct
- typically the investigations are done internally. Is the conduct a significant departure from accepted practices of that research community. 

Golden age of computing, feature size on a transitior on a chip is getting smaller. This could be correlated with computing speeds. At nanoscale, silicon can no longer act as a transistor material. Mores law ended about a decade ago, that increase in compute speed has global impact economically and socially. 

Scientists suspected fraud. It couldve just been thermal noise , the range is different and the curve looks identical. 
the journal nature contacted schon and he claimed it to be an honest mistake. They ended up starting to investigate the fraud with internal and external. 

The committee ended up finding that the datasets are scaled. some data has been manipulated but claims that he is using software incorrectly. sometime no explanation and sometimes he claims it was careless mistake.
- it wasn't reproducible
- there was poor record keeping, data is deleted from hard drive. 
- isolation, all of the allegations involved work done alone by Schon
- too luck, reults always better than competition.
- disregareded by co-authors, too comfortable with their astounding results.

Given the evidence, it there significant depature from accepted practices,
this misconduct is committed intentionally or recklessly
should co-authros be held accountable?

committee was not hard on the co-authors. you need to multi discipline to solve advance science, different expertise will have minimal overlap. you rely on the other person to carry forth the research.
