## peer review

- conflict of interest : reviewers benefit professionally or financially solely through the status as reviewer
- intellectual property : anything published belongs to the author and cannot be used by reviewer
- punctuality : crippling competitors by delaying review
- unreasonable demands: finding endless faults beyond reasonable standards 

## Mentoring

- teach them how to comply with agencies and offices.

## Violation of Employee Ethics

- accepting benefits : accept cash gifts or bribes.
- Influence peddling : solicits benefits in exchange for using her influence unfairly. Taking advantage of position
- Employer's property : personal use, running private business with company computers. Making purchase for your own home
- Moonlighting : take one skill and look employment else where.
- Post-employment : can't work for other employers as non-competeting agreements.

## Conflicts of interest and intellectual property.
- conflict of interest : A confluct between private interests and the offical responsibilities of a person in a position of trust.
- Intellectual property : belongs to company
    - patenting and licensing of inventions : take basic science and engineering discoveries and make them more useful
    - Generate income for others
    - Companies bring experties: organized teams of scientists, proprietary technologies.
    - Impact on others, University paid time is spent on for-profit activities,
    - public trusts: scientists are the sources of scientific truth. Any funny business will compromise public trust.
    - Academic freedom: commercial arragements can inhibit open discussion and sharing of materials. trademark and secrets gives advantages. no publishing.
Best thing to do is just act in good faith and think of the stakeholders. consider how it looks to others and expose it to sunlight. just acknowledge the conflic of interest.
