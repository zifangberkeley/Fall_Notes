    "`Object introspection` describes examining an object to determine\n",
    "- type\n",
    "- state\n",
    "other information about the object at run time.\n",
    "In many cases you should seach online documentations for functions or libraries you are using.\n",
    "- it might be more helpful to inspect the object to find out information about them instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using built in functions for introspection\n",
    "    help is a good way to find out the documentation of the function. It will show us the docstring of the library.\n",
    "    type: retuns the data type of an object. \n",
    "    isinstance: if the object is an instance of a type of object. It can be used to check datatype. \n",

    "    - list are datatype where several related values are grouped together. We just need to put things in brackets.\n",
    "    - you can also create it through the function list.\n",
    "    lists are mutable objects, changing the value and adding things to the list.\n",

    "    Set:\n",
    "    data types are set and frozen set.\n",
    "    set = mutable\n",
