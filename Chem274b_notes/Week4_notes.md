## switch sections
drug modeling. maintaining drug efficiency while maintaining low tixucuty. 
Hybrid models combining attention-based and state pace based.

Due dates will be moved back.

Week4 - discussion 
- introduction
    we have directed graph structures. why do we need it and the difference between undirected and directed.
- digraph interface
    the edges have directionality to them. they point in one direction.
    you can use a digraph to represent road ways. 
Implication graph and combinatiorial circuits can be modeled through digraphs.
Word net graphs.
digraph is good for maybe finding out the shortest path. 
or maybe a topologcial sort where we draw a digraph 
there will be a node text file that will point to other nodes. 
Digraph interface:
how to initialize the digraph. 
- digraph search
    we must consider reachability of our nodes.
    every undirected graphs are just digraphs. 
depth first search marks vertexs as visted and then recursivelty vist all unmarked vertices pointing from v
every program is based on reachability, this allows for dead code elimnination and infinite loop detection. Every program actually is a digraphs.   

- topological sort

- strong components
- molecules as graphs.
