    "# 4.1 Object Introspection\n",
    "better understand what's going on in our program. Good for debugging. It will improve our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Object introspection` describes examining an object to determine\n",
    "- type\n",
    "- state\n",
    "other information about the object at run time.\n",
    "In many cases you should seach online documentations for functions or libraries you are using.\n",
    "- it might be more helpful to inspect the object to find out information about them instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using built in functions for introspection\n",
    "    help is a good way to find out the documentation of the function. It will show us the docstring of the library.\n",
    "    type: retuns the data type of an object. \n",
    "    isinstance: if the object is an instance of a type of object. It can be used to check datatype. \n",
    "    dir: see attributes and methods available on an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built in python data types:\n",
    "These are the datatypes without doing imports. \n",
    "`mutable` changeable data\n",
    "`immutable` unchangeable object. Cannot be changed after it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datatypes:\n",
    "`Numerics`: float, int and complex\n",
    "`Sequences`: list,tubple, range and str\n",
    "`sets`: set, frozenset\n",

    "A little bit of introspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro to numeric types\n",
    "    These consists of float, in and complex numbers\n",
    "    integers are immutable objects.\n",
    "    when we add something to an integer, it won't be the same object that we are working with anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Floating point numbers:\n",
    "    -  These are also immutable objects. it corresponds to double.\n",
    "    - the methods are very similar to int. \n",
    "\n",
    "    complex numbers:\n",
    "    - imaginary numbers with real parts and imaginary parts. for example, taking squareroot of negative numbers.\n",
    "    - to do math on complex numbers you have to use the c math library. \n",
    "    - These are also immutable objects. we can't modify and have them created with the same object id.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro to sequences and sets\n",
    "    List, tuples, string and range.\n",
    "    - Ordered collections of data. the order of the sequence matters.\n",
    "    they support iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python list vs python tuples\n",
    "    - list are datatype where several related values are grouped together. We just need to put things in brackets.\n",
    "    - you can also create it through the function list.\n",
    "    lists are mutable objects, changing the value and adding things to the list.\n",
    "    tuples on the other hand are immutable objects.\n",
    "        - (numbers) or tuple([numbers])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    python strings\n",
    "    - strings are sequences and consists of characters. they are immutable. \n",
    "    functions don't modify inplace. you will have to capture it in another variable.\n",
    "    There are alot of methods for you to modify the strings in place. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Set:\n",
    "    data types are set and frozen set.\n",
    "    set = mutable\n",
    "    frozen immutable. these are unordered sets of data. where orders don't matter. But can only contain unique values.\n",
    "    Check what exists in one list and what is not. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Mappings:\n",
    "    dictionaries: It maps key value pairs. in a dictionary it's a collection of data, we can access it using names and strings which are referred to as keys. Keys must be immutable data types.\n",
    "    check below for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "    if we want to get information from our dictonary, we can use:\n",
    "    .keys() : to see all the keys\n",
    "    .values() : to see all the values\n",
    "    .items() : returns a list of tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Iterations through dictionaries.\n",
    "    we can see how many elements in our dictionary with the len() function.\n",
    "    we can actually loop through a dictionary. it will give us all the keys.\n",
    "        - we should use .items. and do a double loop. for k,v in enthalpies.items()\n",
    "                                                            if v>0:\n",
