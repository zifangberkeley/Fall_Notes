In the mincut problem, an edge weighted digraph, with source vertexs and target vertex t/'
a st cut is a oartition of the vertices into two disjoint sets. with s in one set a and t in the other set b 
The capacity is the sum of the capacities of the edges from A to B 

We don't count edges from B to A. 
min cut problem is taking a cut to result in minimum capacity. can be use in finding where to cut supply chain.

maxflow problem:

a st-f;pw is an assignment to edges such that
-   capacity constraint: 0< edge's flow < edge capacity>>
local equailibrium the inflow = outflow at every vertex (except s and t)

the value of the flow is the inflow.
- with the assumption no edges point t os or from t. 
the maxflow problem is to find a flow of maximum volume.
-   want to do it max supplies to a location. 
-   maximize the flow of information to a specific set of people.

Both of the same input. and the two results are actually the same. Being able to solve one problem allows you to solve the other problem.
